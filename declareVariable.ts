//Syntax for declaring variables with TS.
//let variableName: type = value;

let greeting: string = 'Hello Varun';
console.log(greeting);

//After this we won't be able to assign any diffrent data type to greeting variable.
//So there is more safety with with TS where JS simply allows almost anything.

//If we type ' greeting. ' then it will show uys the list of methods associated with strings since greeting is a string type.
//Same would happen to diffent data tyoes and their methods.
